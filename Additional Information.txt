TitanLock-512 is a custom-built, modular block cipher operating on 512-bit blocks with 512-bit keys. 
Designed as an experimental encryption suite, it blends modern cryptographic practices with bespoke transformation logic, key scheduling, message authentication, and flexible password-based encryption.
This tool is intended for educational, research, and exploratory purposes.

  512-bit block size — 4× larger than AES
  Custom round transformation logic — bitwise rotations, XOR diffusion, nonlinear mutation
  CBC Mode encryption
  PKCS#7-style padding
  MAC generation via SHA-512 (EVP digest API)
  PBKDF2-based key derivation — password-secured with random salt
  Random IV and salt handling
  CLI interface for file-based encryption
  OpenSSL 3.0+ compatible

Compile from Source
gcc titanlock512.c -o titanlock512 -lcrypto

How to use 
./titanlock512 -e input.txt encrypted.bin
